        <h1>About myself</h1>
        <p>Just someone trying to learn coding to have a bit of respect from my parents while including my interest of cooking, if I helped you it would also mean a lot to me</p>
        <h2>How this website should work</h2>
        <p>There are couple of hyperlinks which I will make a "expansion" menu in the future once I have learn everything.</p>
        <p>Right now I am new and you can learn the easiest recipes like scrambled eggs to some more advanced ones which I am still figuring out.</p>
        <p>Some recipes here are not avaliable on other websites as they are self made while some are improved from what I learnt.</p>
